MXLMediaView
============

This is a class designed to show a UIImage and blur & shrink the background. Similar to the Facebook app.

Compatibility
--------
MXLMediaView uses UIKit Dynamics for the gravity effect so is only compatible with iOS 7 right now.

Usage
-----
The only externa dependency is on Apple's [UIImage+ImageEffects](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=wwdc_2013/wwdc_2013_sample_code/ios_uiimageeffects.zip), which is included in this repo.

The process of showing an image in your app is dead simple. First import the class:
```objectivec
#import "MXLMediaView.h"
```
And then:
```objectivec
-(void)pushShowImageButton:(id)sender {
    MXLMediaView *mediaView = [[MXLMediaView alloc] init];
    [mediaView setDelegate:self];

    [mediaView showImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"daft_punk@2x.jpg"] inParentView:self.view completion:^{
      NSLog(@"Done showing MXLMediaView");
    }];
}
```
or to show a video...
```objectivec
-(void)pushShowVideoButton:(id)sender {
    MXLMediaView *mediaView = [[MXLMediaView alloc] init];
    [mediaView setDelegate:self];
    
    // The best video on the Internet.
    NSURL *videoURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://website.com/video.mp4"];
    
    [mediaView showVideoWithURL:videoURL inParentView:self.navigationController.view completion:^{
        NSLog(@"Complete");
    }];
}
```

Delegate methods:
```objectivec
-(void)mediaView:(MXLMediaView *)mediaView didReceiveLongPressGesture:(id)gesture {
    NSLog(@"MXLMediaViewDelgate: Long pressed received");
}

-(void)mediaViewWillDismiss:(MXLMediaView *)mediaView {
    NSLog(@"MXLMediaViewDelgate: Will dismiss");
}

-(void)mediaViewDidDismiss:(MXLMediaView *)mediaView {
    NSLog(@"MXLMediaViewDelgate: Did dismiss");
}
```


Installation
-----
MXLMediaView is now installable via Cocoapods!
```ruby

```
